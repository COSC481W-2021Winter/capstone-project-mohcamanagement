Description:<br>
Bob Johnson is a middle aged manager who works for Dunkin Donuts. Working at the cafe is fun but a bit challenging at times because he has dealt with a lot on a daily basis. One of the tasks he has to do daily is inventory which he has to write down from a sheet everytime he does it. Which is a bit annoying because he has to go around to different locations of the store like back to the kitchen or up front by the register to find the inventory lists he uses. Items he has to take inventory of are things like the dry goods they have as backups or how much coffee they have for the next days. He has always hoped to have some sort of application that would streamline the process for him and his supervisors. Things he has hoped an app would have are all of the lists in one location so going around to mark down what he has as a backup would take less time since he wouldn't have to write down the lists before taking the inventory.<br><br>
Another problem that he works with weekly is creating a schedule for all of his employees. Bob uses Microsoft's Excel to create the schedules and has a templete that he has created that he fills in weekly. He spends a lot of time every week creating these schedules because he has to keep in mind how much each employee can work as well as which employees work well together. Each week he uses the last weeks schedule as a starting point for making the new one but with the ever changing needs of his employees it rarly stays the same. He has another speadsheet with all of his employees availability and requests off but sometimes he misses certain requests. His employees tend to email him with the problems that were missed in generating the schedule, like if the employee had previously requested time off. Bob is always trying to find a new way to be more efficient so he can spend less time on the schedule and more time with his family and friends.<br>
