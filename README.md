Description:<br>
Bob Johnson is a middle aged manager who works for Dunkin Donuts. Working at the cafe is fun but a bit challenging at times because he has dealt with a lot on a daily basis. One of the tasks he has to do daily is inventory. Which is a bit annoying because he has to go around to different locations of the store to find the inventory lists he has to fill out. He has always hoped to have some sort of application that would streamline the process for him and his supervisors.<br>
Another problem that he works with weekly is creating a schedule for all of his employees. He spends a lot of time every week creating these schedules. His employees tend to email him with the problems that were missed in generating the schedule, like if the employee had previously requested time off. Bob is always trying to find a new way to be more efficient so he can spend less time on the schedule and more time with his family and friends.<br>
